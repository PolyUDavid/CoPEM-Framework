## 🎯 Data Usage Guide

### For Reproducing Paper Results

**Use**: `copem_paper_results.json`

```python
import json

# Load paper results
with open('data/paper_data/copem_paper_results.json', 'r') as f:
    results = json.load(f)

# Access core achievements
energy_recovery = results['core_achievements']['single_vehicle_energy_recovery_percent']
print(f"Energy Recovery: {energy_recovery}%")  # 36.5%

# Access Euro NCAP results
ccrs_results = results['euro_ncap_results']['ccrs']
collision_rate = ccrs_results['collision_rate_percent']
print(f"CCRS Collision Rate: {collision_rate}%")  # 0.00%

# Access fleet results
fleet_33_attack = results['fleet_cooperative_results']['attack_33_3_percent']
fault_detection = fleet_33_attack['fault_detection_rate']
print(f"Fault Detection @ 33% Attack: {fault_detection*100}%")  # 92.0%
```

### For Training Analysis

**Use**: `copem_complete_experiment_results_20250714_151845.json`

```python
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load training history
with open('data/paper_data/copem_complete_experiment_results_20250714_151845.json', 'r') as f:
    training_data = json.load(f)

# Plot learning curve
episode_rewards = training_data['episode_rewards']
plt.plot(episode_rewards)
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Reward')
plt.title('CoPEM Training Convergence')
plt.show()
```

### For Fleet Coordination Analysis

**Use**: `copem_case3_fleet_cooperative_results_20250714_172108.json`

```python
import json

# Load fleet results
with open('data/paper_data/copem_case3_fleet_cooperative_results_20250714_172108.json', 'r') as f:
    fleet_data = json.load(f)

# Analyze Byzantine attack impact
for attack_level in ['0%', '16.7%', '33.3%', '50.0%']:
    attack_key = f'attack_{attack_level}'
    if attack_key in fleet_data:
        consensus_quality = fleet_data[attack_key]['consensus_quality']
        print(f"{attack_level} Attack → Consensus Quality: {consensus_quality}%")
```

## 🔍 Data Interpretation Notes

### Energy Recovery Metrics

**36.5% Single-Vehicle Energy Recovery**:
- Measured as: `E_recovered / E_total_braking`
- Weighted average across all Euro NCAP scenarios
- Accounts for battery thermal limits (Eco-TES predictions)
- Based on 1050+ individual test runs

**187.9% Fleet Energy Improvement**:
- Improvement vs. non-cooperative baseline
- Measured in 6-vehicle platoon scenarios
- Benefits from temporal and spatial coordination
- Does NOT mean >100% energy recovery (that's physically impossible)
- Means: Fleet recovers 2.88× more energy than independent operation

### Consensus Quality Under Attack

**29.6% at 33.3% Byzantine Attack**:
- This is the **degraded quality** metric (how much raw consensus degrades)
- The **effective quality** is 89.6% (after fault detection and isolation)
- System maintains 99% collision avoidance at this attack level
- This represents "graceful degradation" not system failure
- Theoretical Byzantine tolerance limit is f < N/3 (33.3% for N=6)

**Interpretation**:
- 29.6% = Consensus quality if Byzantine nodes were NOT detected
- 89.6% = Actual consensus quality after trust-weighted filtering
- The difference shows the effectiveness of the trust mechanism

### Response Time

**8.5 ms End-to-End Latency**:
- Includes: Sensor fusion (0.8ms) + Eco-TES (1.2ms) + Co-ESDRL (0.3ms) + HOCBF (2.1ms)
- Does NOT include physical brake actuation time (~50ms)
- Measured on GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090)
- CPU-only latency: 20.6 ms (still real-time)
